## Fast 2D LPs

Since vectors in the plane can be ordered
by the angle with respect to the positive real axis, we can efficiently evaluate
the support vector of a polygon in constraint representation by comparing normal directions, provided that its edges are ordered. We use the symbol $\preceq$ to compare directions, where the increasing direction is counter-clockwise.
